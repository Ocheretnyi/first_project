# Changelog

[Shamil Kashmeri](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105291845791114608759) asked whether he should upgrade from 0.1 to 0.3 and I thought it would be a good idea for making a changelog instead of explaining the new features everytime someone asks. So, here you go :

## 0.3

- Updates to existing features
- Added feature for blocking brute force attacks with settings variables

## 0.2

- Updates to existing features
- Remember Me option on login
- Improved $LS->init()
- Added $LS->getUser() for easy retrieval of user information
- Added $LS->updateUser() to easily update user information
- Added functionality for getting time since the user joined
- Added $LS->sendMail() for easily updating the preferred way of sending mails

## 0.1

- Login, Register and basic functions of a login system
- Forgot Password feature
- $LS->init()
